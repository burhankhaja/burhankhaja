## Hi there 👋
_🌱 I'm web3 security researcher, specializing in solidity and rust. My solidity skills are advance while Im sharping rust skills day by day as im currently learning solana development using native rust and anchor framework. For auditing solidity contracts, I specialize in foundry framework for unit tests, certora prover for formal verification and a sharp eye to detect bugs using manual verification and also other easy stuff too like using those automatic scannerls like slither etc too._

_These days i keep juggling rust and solidity audit contests as many as i could and until Feb 11 i am working on Silo Finance formal verification contest held on cantina_

_I would love to collaborate on development and audit projects especially solidity ones_

<!--_💬 Ask me about ... solidity, formal verification (solidity), rust, auditing, solana development, anchor framework, ethers.js and solana/web3.js_ -->

_**Warning:**_ _You can easily measure my passion for blockchain technologies by my pronouns, which are u32 / int128 and the crazy part is that i identify as a bi-compiler 😄_
