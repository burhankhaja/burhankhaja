## Hi there 👋
_I'm web3 security researcher, specializing in solidity and rust. My solidity skills are advance while Im sharping rust skills day by day as im currently learning solana development using native rust and anchor framework._ 

_For auditing solidity contracts, I specialize in foundry framework for unit tests, certora prover for formal verification and a sharp eye to detect bugs by manual code review and I can easily use slither like automatic scanner tools too_

_These days i keep juggling rust and solidity audit contests as many as i could and am always open for the job oportunities_

_I would love to collaborate on development and audit projects especially solidity ones_

<!--_💬 Ask me about ... solidity, formal verification (solidity), rust, auditing, solana development, anchor framework, ethers.js and solana/web3.js_ -->

_**Warning:**_ _You can easily measure my passion for blockchain technologies by my pronouns, which are u32 / int128 and the crazy part is that i identify as a bi-compiler 😄_
